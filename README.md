# RawRipe Dataset

A comprehensive dataset of fruit images in both raw and ripe states, designed for fruit maturity recognition tasks. The dataset includes images of 10 different fruit types, enabling various classification approaches from agricultural, market, and automation perspectives.

## Dataset Description

The RawRipe Dataset contains images of fruits in both raw and ripe states, collected for research in fruit maturity recognition. This dataset is specifically designed for computer vision and deep learning applications in agricultural detection and classification tasks.

### Data Summary

The dataset includes 10 types of fruits:
- Apple
- Banana
- Coconut
- Guava
- Litchi
- Mango
- Orange
- Papaya
- Pomegranate
- Strawberry

Each fruit is represented in both raw and ripe states.

## Applications

This dataset can be used to solve three types of classification problems:

1. Raw vs Ripe for a specific fruit (agricultural perspective)
2. Raw vs Ripe for any fruit (market perspective)
3. Multi-class/label classification (automation perspective)

# Multi-species Fruit Flower Detection Dataset

A comprehensive dataset of flower images from three different fruit species (apple, peach, and pear) with accompanying ground truth images. The dataset was collected under various imaging conditions to support research in flower identification algorithms that are robust to uncontrolled environments.

## Dataset Description

This dataset consists of four sets of flower images and their corresponding ground truth labels, designed for developing and testing flower detection algorithms in orchard environments. The images were acquired using different cameras and under various conditions to ensure robustness.

### Data Summary

The dataset includes images from three species:
- Apple (Two sets: AppleA and AppleB)
- Peach
- Pear

### Dataset Components

1. **AppleA Dataset**
   - 147 images acquired with Canon EOS 60D
   - Includes training and validation splits
   - Binary ground truth labels (white for flower pixels, black for non-flower pixels)

2. **AppleB Dataset**
   - 15 images acquired with GoPro HERO 5
   - Binary ground truth labels

3. **Peach Dataset**
   - 20 images acquired with GoPro HERO 5
   - Binary ground truth labels

4. **Pear Dataset**
   - 15 images of free-standing pear tree
   - Acquired with GoPro HERO 5
   - Binary ground truth labels

## Applications

This dataset is particularly useful for:
- Developing flower detection algorithms
- Testing robustness in uncontrolled environments
- Multi-species flower identification
- Precision agriculture applications
- Orchard management and fruit load estimation
